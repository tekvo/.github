## 🎯 What Tekvo Does

Most AI projects fail **after deployment**: data shifts, accuracy drops, retraining becomes expensive, and teams are left managing complexity.

**Tekvo solves this by owning the full AI lifecycle end-to-end**—from data to production to continuous improvement.

---

## 🛡️ Why Tekvo (Our Moat)

### 1) Closed-loop AI lifecycle (AI that improves after launch)
We capture real-world signals from production and turn them into targeted improvements:
- drift detection → failure capture → re-annotation → retraining → safe rollout

### 2) Data-centric delivery (what compounds over time)
We build durable advantages using:
- versioned datasets + lineage
- domain-aware annotation standards
- quality signals (confidence, disagreement)

### 3) Production-grade governance (enterprise-ready)
We deliver AI with:
- audit-ready tracking
- safe rollout patterns (shadow/canary)
- monitoring & reliability guardrails

---

## 🔄 Our AI Delivery Lifecycle

We stay responsible for the entire lifecycle:

1. **Collect** — gather data from databases, apps, files, APIs, streams  
2. **Annotate** — human-in-the-loop labeling with domain rules  
3. **Curate** — balance, filter, select the right examples  
4. **Prepare** — clean + transform data for training  
5. **Train** — train/fine-tune models for your use cases  
6. **Validate** — evaluate performance + edge cases  
7. **Deploy** — production deployment with safe rollout  
8. **Refine** — monitor drift + continuously improve
